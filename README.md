# dpdk-multi-process-rss
Symmetric Multiprocess Template with S-RSS (XL710 specific)

Set `RTE_SDK` properly, then `make`.

A executable will be built in `build` directory.
The running parameters are the same with the `multi_process` example of DPDK.

Tested with DPDK-18.x, might not work with 19.x
